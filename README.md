Updating Gems one by one is a bumm(e)r: especially when one gem causes your build
to fail.

Gems should be updated in [separate commits](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/keep-your-gems-up-to-date).

The bummr gem allows you to automatically update all gems which pass your
build in separate commits, and logs the name and sha of any gem update that fails your build.

Bummr assumes you have good test coverage and follow a [pull-request workflow].

By default, bummr will assume your base branch is named `main`. If you would
like to designate a different base branch, you can set the `BASE_BRANCH`
environment variable: `export BASE_BRANCH='main'`

## Compatibility

| Bundler Version | Bummr Version |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| <= 2.1          | <= 0.6.0      |
| >= 2.2          | >= 1.0.0      |

## Setup

```bash
$ gem install bummr
```

To run headless (skip interactive rebasing/confirmation), use
`BUMMR_HEADLESS=true bundle exec bummr update`.

By default, bummr will use `bundle exec rake` to run your build.

To customize your build command, `export BUMMR_TEST="./bummr-build.sh"`

If you prefer, you can [run the build more than once], to protect against
brittle tests and false positives.

## Usage

Using bummr can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending
on the number of outdated gems you have and the number of tests in your test
suite.

For the purpose of these instructions, we are assuming that your base branch is
`main`. If you would like to specify a different base branch, see the
instructions in the Installation section of this README.

- After installing, create a new, clean branch off of your main branch.
- Run `bummr update`. This may take some time.
- `Bummr` will give you the opportunity to interactively rebase your branch
  before running the tests. Careful.
- At this point, you can leave `bummr` to work for some time.
- If your build fails, `bummr` will notify you of failures, logging the failures to
  `log/bummr.log`. At this point it is recommended that you lock that gem version in
  your Gemfile and start the process over from the top. Alternatively, you may wish
  to implement code changes which fix the problem.
- Once your build passes, open a pull-request and merge it to your main branch.

##### `bummr update`

- Options:

  - `--all` to include indirect dependencies (`bummr` defaults to direct dependencies only)
  - `--group` to update only gems from a specific group (i.e. `test`, `development`)
  - `--gem` to update only a specific gem (i.e. `tzinfo`)

- Finds all your outdated gems
- Updates them each individually, using `bundle update --source #{gemname}`. To use a less
  conservative update strategy, start `bummr update` with the `--all` option.
- Commits each gem update separately, with a commit message like:

```
Update gemname from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2
```

- Runs `git rebase -i main` to allow you the chance to review and make changes.
- Runs `bummr test`

##### `bummr test`

- Runs your build script (`.bummr-build.sh`).
- If there is a failure, runs `bummr bisect`.

##### `bummr bisect`

- `git bisect`s against main.
- Upon finding the bad commit, runs `git bisect reset` and notifies the developer on
  how best to proceed.
- Logs the bad commit in `log/bummr.log`.

## Notes

- Bummr assumes you have good test coverage and follow a [pull-request workflow]
  with `main` as your default branch.
- Once the build passes, you can push your branch and create a pull-request!
- You may wish to `tail -f log/bummr.log` in a separate terminal window so you
  can see which commits are being removed.

## Developing

Set version in `lib/bummr/version.rb`

`rake build` to build locally

`gem install --local ./pkg/bummr-X.X.X.gem` with the ruby version of the app
you'd like to use it with.

`rake` will run the suite of unit tests.

`gem push ./pkg/bummr-x.x.x.gem` to publish new versions.

The suite relies on Oliver Peate's [jet
black](https://github.com/odlp/jet_black) testing library for command line feature
tests.
